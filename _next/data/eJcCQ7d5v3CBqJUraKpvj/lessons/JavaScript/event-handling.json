Events are actions or\noccurrences that happen in the browser, such as clicking a button, typing in a form field, or hovering over an image.\nJavaScript allows you to respond to these events by executing specific code when they occur. This is achieved through\nevent listeners.\n\n## What are Events?\n\nAn event in JavaScript is anything that happens in the browser, usually triggered by user interaction or the browser\nitself. Common events include:\n\n* **click:** When an element is clicked.\n* **mouseover:** When the mouse pointer is moved over an element.\n* **keydown:** When a key is pressed on the keyboard.\n* **submit:** When a form is submitted.\n* **load:** When the browser has finished loading a page.\n\nEach event has a corresponding event type, and JavaScript allows you to \"listen\" for these events and respond\naccordingly.\n\n## Adding Event Listeners\n\nEvent listeners are used to attach specific code (also known as event handlers) to an event on an element. When the\nevent occurs, the attached event handler is executed.\n\n```js\nlet button = document.querySelector(\".my-button\");\n\nbutton.addEventListener(\"click\", function() {\n  alert(\"Button was clicked!\");\n});\n```\n\nThis code selects a button element with the class my-button and attaches a click event listener to it. When the button\nis clicked, an alert box with the message \"Button was clicked!\" will appear.\n\n## Commonly Used Events\n\n**a. Click Event:**\nThe `click` event is one of the most frequently used events. It occurs when a user clicks on an element, such as a\nbutton or a link.\n\n```js\nlet button = document.querySelector(\".my-button\");\n\nbutton.addEventListener(\"click\", function() {\n  console.log(\"Button clicked!\");\n});\n```\n\nWhen the button is clicked, the message \"Button clicked!\" is logged to the console.\n\n**b. Mouseover Event:**\nThe `mouseover` event occurs when the mouse pointer is moved over an element.\n\n```js\nlet image = document.querySelector('.my-image');\n\nimage.addEventListener('mouseover', function() {\n  image.style.border = '2px solid red';\n});\n```\n\nWhen the mouse pointer hovers over the image, a red border is added to the image.\n\n**c. Keydown Event:**\nThe `keydown` event occurs when a key is pressed down.\n\n```js\ndocument.addEventListener(\"keydown\", function(event) {\n  console.log(\"Key pressed:\", event.key);\n});\n```\n\nWhen any key is pressed, the key's value is logged to the console. The event.key property gives you the value of the key\nthat was pressed.\n\n**c. Submit Event:**\nThe submit event occurs when a form is submitted. It's commonly used to validate form data before submission.\n\n```js\nlet form = document.querySelector(\"form\");\n\nform.addEventListener(\"submit\", function(event) {\n  event.preventDefault();  // Prevent the form from submitting\n  console.log(\"Form submitted!\");\n});\n```\n\nWhen the form is submitted, the event listener prevents the default submission behavior and logs \"Form submitted!\" to\nthe console. The `event.preventDefault()` method stops the form from actually submitting, which is useful for validating\nthe form data before submission.\n","slug":"event-handling","title":"Event Handling","section":"JavaScript","icon":"wrench","filePath":"/home/runner/work/front-end-for-back-end-engineers/front-end-for-back-end-engineers/lessons/04-JavaScript/I-event-handling.md","nextSlug":"/front-end-for-back-end-engineers/lessons/JavaScript/task","prevSlug":"/front-end-for-back-end-engineers/lessons/JavaScript/interacting-with-the-dom"}},"__N_SSG":true}
