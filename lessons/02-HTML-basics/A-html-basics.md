# Lesson 2: HTML Basics

Now that you’ve got a high-level understanding of front-end and back-end development, it’s time to start building. We’ll
begin with HTML, the backbone of any web page.

## Objective

By the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to create a basic webpage structure using essential HTML tags. You’ll
understand how to lay out content and build the foundation for your website.

## Understanding HTML: The Foundation of the Web

HTML, or **HyperText Markup Language**, is the standard language used to create web pages. It provides the basic
structure of the site, which is then enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.

### Basic Structure of an HTML Document

Every HTML document starts with a specific structure. Here’s the basic template:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
<!-- Your content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

* **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML.
* **`<html>`**: The root element that wraps all the content of the webpage.
* **`<head>`**: Contains meta-information about the document, like the title and linked resources.
* **`<body>`**: This is where the visible content of your webpage goes.
