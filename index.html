  </div>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul class="ingredients">
    <li>2-3 large eggs</li>
    <li>Salt, to taste</li>
    <li>Pepper, to taste</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon of butter or oil</li>
    <li>Optional fillings: cheese, diced vegetables, cooked meats, herbs</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol class="instructions">
    <li><strong>Beat the eggs:</strong> In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well
      mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Heat the pan:</strong> Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</li>
    <li><strong>Cook the omelette:</strong> Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to
      ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Add fillings (optional):</strong> When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny
      in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Fold and serve:</strong> As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the
      fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Enjoy:</strong> Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>
  </ol>
